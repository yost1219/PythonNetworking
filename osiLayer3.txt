Internet Protocol - IP
two main type: IPv4(32 bit (4 octets) addresses, displayed as numbers- 255.255.255.255) 
and IPv6(128 bit (16 octets) addresses, displayed as 8 4-digit hex numbers- ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff)
ran out of available IPv4 addresses in Sep 2015

Layer 3 devices
routers-
bridge-routers (brouters)-
layer 3 switches-

IPv4 addresses
expressed in dotted decimal notation (255.255.255.255)
32 bits in length (4 octets)
determined by Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)

IPv4 classes
class A - first bit is 0 (first octet between 0 and 127)
class B - first two bits are 1 and 0 respectively (first octet between 128 and 191)
class C - first three bits are 1, 1, and 0 (first octet between 192 and 223)
class D - first four bits are 1, 1, 1, and 0 (first octet between 224 and 239)
class E - these two IPs are used for experimentation only (240.0.0.0, and 255.255.255.254)

Subnet mask

CIDR

Routing Protocols
routers operates on layer 3
two types of protocols: distance-vector and link-state
distance-vector based on taking fewest number of hops or devices to get to end
link-state is concerned with speed
hybrid styles also exist

Routing
packets are routed independently even if going to same destination
when a router receives a packet the destination 

NAT and PAT
Network Address Translation modifies an address inside your network to a global IP (conserves IPv4 addresses)
Port Address Translation maps public IP to port number of a device on the network (conserves IPv4 address)

IPv6
back to single address per host, no longer need address translation
multicasting is built-in
needs much more memory space
can autoconfig on a network
128 bits (vs 32 for IPv4)
leading zeros may be omitted (2001:db8:0:0:0:ff00:42:8329 can be written as 2001:db8::ff00:42:8329)
no broadcast address for IPv6
scopes: global, site local, link local
