--OSI model--

Layers 1-7: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application

-All People Seem To Need Data Processing

--Sockets--
two basic types of comm: TCP vs. UDP
TCP(streams) - most common, more secure, send/ack back and forth
UDP(datagrams) - computers send packages to each other, each package is self-contained,
doesn't verify receipt or order on other end
netflix is more like datagrams because it doesn't really care if you receive everything or not
steam is more like streams because you have to get every package in a specific order or the game won't work

--Connections--
ipv4 vs ipv6

--client/server model--

--major system calls--
client and server relationship
3-way handshake

a connection is a unique combo of client IP, client port, server IP, and server port

--socket basics--
to create a socket (first step):
	import socket
	address families
	socket types

--udp client/server--
socket() - get socket descriptor
bind() - specify source port
sendto()/recvfrom() - data transfer
close() - close the socket

--tcp client/server--
tcp is connection oriented and has built-in error checking
sendall()
